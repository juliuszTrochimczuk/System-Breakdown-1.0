# System-Breakdown-1.0
Game created for T3G tournament (I place). Link to game:  https://backbone-studio.itch.io/system-breakdown

Unity version: 2021.1.26f

This project was building by team of 10 people but original source code is in gitlab and I didn't know how to fork this project between two platforms.

My position in project: Game Director
My responsibilities: Writing code, Creating design documets (GDD sucks it was my first time writing it and it also is in polish language), Creating shaders using Shader Graph and Visual Effects using Particle System Effect and Visual Effect System
