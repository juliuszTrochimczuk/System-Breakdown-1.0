# System-Breakdown-1.0
Game created for T3G tournament (I place). Link to game:  https://backbone-studio.itch.io/system-breakdown

Unity version: 2021.1.26f

This project was building by team of 10 people but original source code is in gitlab and I didn't know how to fork this project between two platforms.

My position: Game Director
